   <h2 id="chicken">Chicken</h2>
   <p>This is the most delicious and vibrant take on chicken soup, the get well classic, that I could come up with. Lots of hearty pieces of chicken meat, a sweet broth with lots of bright veggies. I add a touch of heat with hot sauce at the end to get a little sweat going to get all those evil sick bugs out. Make it ahead of time and just heat it up at my friend's house.</p>

   <h2 id ="beef">Beef</h2>
   <p>This is a wonderful chili recipe that I have used to win chili cook-offs in Indiana. It's hearty and spicy award winning chili that is sure to hit the spot on a cold winter's night. The key is in using name brand tomato soup, I have tried it with others but haven't gotten the same results. Your friends will never guess the secret ingredient. Enjoy!</p>

   <h2 id="sushi">Sushi</h2>
   <p>Sushi rolls are the most popular form and these rolls might include a variety of vegetables like chopped scallions, cucumber and avocado. Besides regular rolls, popular sushi includes the Rock and Roll â€” an inside-out roll with barbecued freshwater eel and avocado inside and rice with toasted sesame seeds on the outside. The inside-out roll allows for draping the sashimi on top of the entire roll. With a Tempura Roll, an entire roll is battered and fried tempura style.</p>
